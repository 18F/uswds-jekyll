SCINet sponsored a Data Wrangling workshop supporting 20 USDA participants on February 8th, 2022 from 2:30 to 4:00 CT.

This workshop covered various common unmanned aerial system (UAS) payloads such as RGB and multispectral imagers, hyperspectral sensors, and LIDAR. It provided an overview of how photogrammetry works with RGB/multispectral imagery. A sample processing flow was demonstrated in two of the popular commercial photogrammetry suites, Agisoft Metashape and Pix4D Pix4Dmapper, producing a reflectance-corrected and georeferenced orthomosaic from each software suite.
