There are two ways to do this.

1. Using Github pull requests (preferred)
2. edit online in github
2. Sent your markdown file to Adam Rivers

## The github command line

1. get a GitHub account if you don't have one
2. clone the repository to your computer: `git clone https://github.com/USDA-ARS-GBRU/scinet-site.git`
3. create a new brach for your work
4. Edit your assigned page, photos go in `/assets/img/` and docs go in the location you were assigned
5. When you are done commit your changes:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "here is a description of what I did what I did"
  git push
  ```

6. Then go the main scinet repository and create a pull request

## Edit online in Github
1. get a GitHub account if you don't have one
2. go to the scinet repository: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-GBRU/scinet-site and navigate to your file and click the pencil. this will "fork the archive for you".
3 edit it and say what you did in the comment box and click "propose file change"


## TravisCI builds

After a commit the site is built by Tracis.ci and pushed to the gh-pages branch of the repoto create the web page. See the dashboard for status https://travis-ci.com/github/USDA-ARS-GBRU/scinet-site. Builds use tokens.

## Installation

1. Install the theme as a Ruby Gem by adding it to your `Gemfile`
   like so:

   ```ruby
   gem 'uswds-jekyll'
   ```

1. Fetch and update your bundled gems by running:

   ```sh
   bundle
   ```

1. Set the `theme` in your site's Jekyll configuration,
   `_config.yml`:

   ```yml
   theme: uswds-jekyll
   ```

You will need to restart your Jekyll server to see the effects.

### Install as a new Jekyll site

1. Create a new Jekyll site:
   ```
   jekyll new
   ```
1. Replace the default `gem "minima", "~> 2.0"` gem with the `uswds-jekyll` gem in your `Gemfile`:

   ```ruby
   gem 'uswds-jekyll'
   ```

1. Set the `theme` in your site's Jekyll configuration, `_config.yml`:

   ```yml
   theme: uswds-jekyll
   ```

1. Fetch and update your bundled gems by running:

   ```sh
   bundle
   ```

1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site locally at http://localhost:4000/

### Versioning

To reference a specific version of this theme:

1. Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll/releases) and decide which version you want to use.
1. Specify the version in your `Gemfile`.

   ```ruby
   gem 'uswds-jekyll', '~> 5.0'
   ```

## Configuration

Configuration of common elements ([header](#header), [footer](#footer), [navigation](#navigation), etc.) happens in your project's [data files](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/). See this project's [data directory](_data) for reference configurations of each component.

The [default layout](#layout-default) also provides a mechanism for automatically including [stylesheets](#stylesheets) and [scripts](#scripts) on a site-wide, layout-wide, and per-page basis. See [asset load order](#asset-load-order) for more information.

### Site title

You can change your site's title with the `title` field in `_config.yml`. If you want to provide an alternate title for use _only_ in the site header, you can set the `title` field in `_data/header.yml`.

### Site description

You can change your site's description with the `description` field in `_config.yml`. If you want to override it for a particular page, you can set the `description` field in that page's frontmatter.

### Navigation

This theme's navigation system is powerful and flexible. Named navigational lists live in your project's `_data/navigation.yml`.

By default all links are assumed to be internal to the site. You can add `external: true` to links that are external. You can also add `class: class-name` to add a class to a specific link.

```yml
# _data/navigation.yml

primary:
  - text: Documentation
    href: /docs/
  - text: Support
    href: /help/
    class: highlight
  - text: "18F"
    href: https://18f.gsa.gov
    external: true

  # link objects with a 'links' field will be presented as
  # collapsible link lists. The 'links' field can either be
  # a reference to another link list in this file, or
  # a literal list.

  - text: Section title
    links: <links>
```

This scheme allows you to define navigational elements that can be shared by different components, such as the [header](#header) and [footer](#footer). See the documentation for those components for more info.

### Page title

Set each page's title in its frontmatter:

```
---
title: About us
---
```

### Page subnavigation

If you're using the [page layout](#layout-page), each page may declare its own side navigation and subnavigation in its front matter:

```md
---
sidenav: documentation
subnav:
  - text: Section one
    href: '#section-one'
  - text: Section two
    href: '#section-two
---

## Section one

## Section two
```

As with the [header](#header) and [footer](#footer), the `sidenav` field may either reference a common [navigation list](#navigation) from `_data/navigation.yml` (recommended) or be a literal list of links.

The `subnav` field should be used to link to sections _within_ the current page, because links to other pages will cause the linking page's side navigation to collapse when visited.

`sidenav` is a key _into_ `_data/navigation.yml`. See the [navigation](#navigation) docs for more info.

A page's "current" or "active" state in the sidenav is determined by whether a link's `href` matches `page.url` or `page.permalink` for each page being rendered.

`subnav` is a list of links to display on this page under its own link in the side navigation.

**Note that subnav link hrefs are not prefixed with `site.baseurl`** because this breaks hash links prefixed with `#`.

**Pro tip:** Unless your Jekyll configuration specifies otherwise, the default Markdown formatter (Kramdown) will automatically generate predictable `id` attributes for your page headings and convert markdown like this:

```md
## Section one
```

into:

```html
<h2 id="section-one">Section one</h2>
```

If you're using Redcarpet, you will need to configure it to enable the `with_toc_data` extension in your `_config.yml`, like so:

```yml
markdown: redcarpet
redcarpet:
  extensions:
    - with_toc_data
```

**Pro tip:** If you're like us and prefer your navigation sticky, you can add `sticky_sidenav: true` on [page](#layout-page), [project](#layout-project), and [team member](#layout-team-member) layouts to have the sidenav follow as you scroll.

### Hero

```yml
hero: # optional
  image: /path/to/image.jpg # optional
  callout:
    alt: Callout white text! # optional
    text: The rest of the callout
  button: # optional
    text: The button text
    href: /button-href/
```

### Tagline intro

```yml
# optional, but must be used in conjunction with 'intro', below
tagline: A tagline for your page
# also optional, but must be used with 'tagline', above
intro: |
  Some introductory text content.

  This will be processed as **Markdown**.
```

### Graphics list

```yml
# an optional list of graphics to display before or after the content
graphics:
  - image:
      # note the indentation here: graphics[n].image.src
      src: /path/to/image.ext
      alt: optional alt text
    title: Optional graphic title, rendered as an <h3>
    description: Graphic description text, processed as _Markdown_.

# optional
graphics_position: (before|after)
```

### Color configuration

The default colors can be configured in the `_data/theme.yml` file. Other settings can be configured using USWDS theme settings. (See the [customization](#customization) section, below.)

### Search

[Search.gov](https://search.gov/) is used for search and can be configured in `_config.yml`.

Before configuring your search you will need to create a search.gov account and set up your website
with search.gov.

After setting up your site on search.gov you can then add your `search_site_handle` to the `config.yml`.

### Analytics

#### Google Analytics

You can add Google Analytics to your site by uncommenting the `google_analytics_ua` line and replacing `UA-????????-??` with your Google analytics UA code.

```
# Configuration for Google Analytics, add your UA code here:
# google_analytics_ua: UA-????????-??
```

#### Digital Analytics Program (DAP)

You can add DAP to your site by uncommenting the `dap_agency` line and, if need be, replacing `GSA` with the appropriate agency key. And optionally, `dap_subagency` may also be specified. For more information visit <https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/>

```
# Configuration for DAP, add your agency ID here:
# dap_agency: GSA
# dap_subagency: TTS
```

### Last modified date

To show the last date a page was last modified by:

1. Add this line to the `footer.yml` data file:

    ```yml
    last_updated: true
    ```

1. Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

    ```ruby
    group :jekyll_plugins do
      gem "jekyll-last-modified-at"
    end
    ```

This will add the date right before the footer component.

### Anchor JS

You can show an anchor link next to header tags by uncommenting this section from the `_config.yml` data file. This will add an anchor link after the header tag on the page and post layouts making ech header linkable. See https://github.com/bryanbraun/anchorjs for more information.

```yml
# anchor_js_targets: [h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6]
```

## Assets

The [stylesheet](_includes/styles.html) and [script](_includes/scripts.html) includes each incorporate the USWDS CSS and JS files if the corresponding `styles` and `scripts` lists aren't defined in your `_config.yml`. So unless you add one or both of those manually, your HTML will include the following:

```html
<!-- in the <head> -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/uswds/css/uswds.min.css" media="screen">
<!-- before </body> -->
<script src="/assets/uswds/js/uswds.min.js" async>
```

Read more about customizing [stylesheets](#stylesheets) and [scripts](#scripts) below.

### Stylesheets

As a general rule, all stylesheets are inserted in a layouts' `<head>`, which qualifies them as "render-blocking". Site stylesheets can be specified in `_config.yml` or a layout or page's [front matter] YAML in the following form:

```yml
styles:
  - /path/to/sheet.css
  - href: /path/to/sheet.css
    media: (screen|print|all) # optional
```

Stylesheets specified as objects (in the latter item above) must have an `href` property. The `media` defaults to `screen`.

### Scripts

As a general rule, all scripts are inserted before a layouts' `</body>`, which prevents them from blocking the rendering of your page's content. Scripts can be specified in `_config.yml` or a layout or page's [front matter] YAML in the following form:

```yml
scripts:
  - /path/to/script.js
  - src: /path/to/script.js
    async: true # optional
```

Scripts specified as objects (in the latter item above) must have a `src` property. Scripts with `async: true` will get an `async` attribute, which tells the browser _not_ to let this script's loading block the execution of subsequent scripts. If the execution order of your scripts is **not** important, setting `async: true` may provide performance benefits to your users. (Conversely, if you don't know whether your scripts need to execute in a particular order, then you should not set `async: true` because it may prevent your scripts from running propertly.)

### Asset load order

Both [stylesheets](#stylesheets) and [scripts](#scripts) can be configured

1. Assets configured at the `site` level (in your `_config.yml`) will be loaded
   in all pages that use the USWDS [layouts](#layouts).
1. Those configured at the layout level (in that layout's [front
   matter]) will be loaded on all pages that use that layout, after
   site assets.
1. Those configured at the page level (in the page's [front matter])
   will be loaded last.

## Customization

Customize the USWDS Jekyll theme with [USWDS theme settings files](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/settings/), [USWDS design tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/), and custom Sass or CSS. You'll need to place USWDS settings and custom Sass into a couple specific locations for the theme to find them.

1. **Settings:** Add custom USWDS settings to `_sass/_uswds-theme-settings.scss`. Settings control the USWDS output. See all available settings in the [USWDS settings documentation](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/settings/). We recommend adding only your modified settings to the `_uswds-theme-settings.scss` file.

    To see an example of all the settings available to USWDS, see the files [in the USWDS GitHub repo](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/tree/develop/src/stylesheets/theme). The repo splits settings into multiple files. If you want to copy and mimic that structure, download the repo files using a tool like [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/uswds/uswds/tree/develop/src/stylesheets/theme). Then add them to the `_sass/` directory and `@import` them from `_uswds-theme-settings.scss`.

    Whether you add only individual settings variables or import from multiple files, `_uswds-theme-settings.scss` needs to be the entry point.

1. **Custom Sass and variables:** Add any custom CSS or Sass to `_sass/_uswds-theme-custom-styles.scss`. You can use this custom styles file to `@import` any _additional_ Sass or CSS files your project needs, as long as any additional files exist in the `/_sass` directory.

    Custom Sass loads after the USWDS and default Sass, so you can use it to override the defaults. Individual sites can also [selectively override](#overriding-includes-and-layouts) individual includes and layouts.

### Overriding includes and layouts

Any [include](_includes) or [layout](_layouts) can be overridden by
your site by placing a file with the same name into your site's
`_includes` or `_layouts` directory. For instance:

- You can change how the side navigation is rendered (but not which
  data it receives) in the [page layout](#layout-page) by creating
  your own `_includes/sidenav.html`.

- You can change how and whether the side navigation is displayed
  at all in the [page layout](#layout-page) by overriding
  `_layouts/page.html`.

## Components

For some [USWDS components](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/), there are two different files that control how data is passed to
the template:

1. `components/{component}.html` is the low-level template that assumes a similarly named global template variable. For instance, the header component operates on the `header` template variable.
1. `{component}.html` is the "concrete" implementation of the component that sets the appropriate global variable then includes the low-level template.

This separation allows you to override either of the component includes in your own Jekyll site without having to re-implement either the high- or low-level logic. For instance, if you want your header data to come directly from the Jekyll configuration file (`_config.yml`) rather than `_data/header.yml`, you can override `_includes/header.html` to look like this:

```html
{% assign header = site.data.header %} {% include components/header--basic.html
%}
```

### Header

The [header.html include](_includes/header.html) sets the `header` template variable to `site.data.header`, the value of which is set in your Jekyll project's `_data/header.yml` file. Then it includes [components/header.html](_includes/components/header.html) to render the header's markup.

See this repo's [header.yml](_data/header.yml) for more info.

### Footer

The [footer.html include](_includes/footer.html) sets the `footer` template variable to `site.data.footer`, the value of which is set in your Jekyll project's `_data/footer.yml` file. Then it includes [components/footer.html](_includes/components/footer.html) to
render the footer's markup.

See this repo's [footer.yml](_data/footer.yml) for more info.

## Layouts

This theme provides the following layouts, which you can use by setting the `layout` [front matter] on each page, like so:

```yml
---
layout: name
---

```

Supported (optional) front matter for page layouts.

- [page navigation](#page-subnavigation)
- [hero](#hero)
- [tagline intro](#tagline-intro)
- [graphics list](#graphics-list)

### `layout: default`

This is the bare-bones USWDS layout, which does all of the basic page scaffolding then drops the page content into the `<main>` element. All of the other layouts "inherit" this one and provide other features in the content block.

The default layout provides a layout [front matter] hook to add attributes to the `<main>` element. You can see how this works in the [page layout](_layouts/page.html#L3-L4).

### `layout: home`

This layout implements the [home page
template](https://designsystem.digital.gov/page-templates/landing/), which accommodates the following [front matter]:

Check out the YAML front matter in the [home demo page](demo/home.html) for an example of how to structure it.

### `layout: page`

This layout implements the [document page template](https://designsystem.digital.gov/page-templates/docs/).

See the [page demo page](demo/page.md) for an example of how this works, and see [\_data/navigation.yml](_data/navigation.yml) for how to structure named navigation data for your site.

### `layout: post`

This layout is identical to the layout `page` and is included to allow for easier site creation using `Jekyll new`.

### `layout: project`

This layout is used to show details for an individual project and uses the following front matter.

```yml
layout: project
title: Title of project
permalink: /projects/link-to-project/
description: Project description.
large_image: /path/to/image.ext
small_image: /path/to/image.ext
image_alt: The image alt text
```

To show a listing of projects on a page add `{% include project-list.html %} to the page`

### `layout: team-member`

This layout is used to show details for an individual team member and uses the following front matter.

```yml
layout: team-member
permalink: /team/link-to-team-member/
name: Team member name
image: /path/to/image.ext
job_title: Team member job title
phone: 123-456-7890
email: email@address.gov
```

To show a listing of team members on a page add `{% include team-list.html %} to the page`

## Migration

### From [guides_style_18f](https://github.com/18F/guides-style)

See [this example pull request](https://github.com/18F/before-you-ship/pull/458).

### From earlier versions

**Note:** `uswds-jekyll` 5.x is only compatible with Jekyll 4.0 and higher.

1. Update your `uswds-jekyll` gem in your project's Gemfile. Replace the current `gem 'uswds-jekyll'` line with:

   ```ruby
   gem 'uswds-jekyll', '~> 5.0'
   ```

   Then, in the terminal, run

   ```sh
   bundle update uswds-jekyll
   ```

1. If you have an existing `_sass` folder, it needs to move to the root level, and out of any directory like `/assets`.
1. Add or move any custom styles or variables to `/_sass/_uswds-theme-custom-styles.scss`.

    If you have multiple custom styles files, add them to the `/_sass` directory and `@import` them from `_uswds-theme-custom-styles.scss`.
1. Convert manual values to tokenized values using the guidance on the [USWDS migration page](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/migration/#spacing-units).
1. Don't duplicate the `h1` in the body content of `page` template pages. (This is automatically inserted at the top with the content of `page.title`.)
1. Check that certain data keys exist

1. Check that css is referencing `uswds-theme.css`

## Development

To develop this theme and/or test it locally:

1. Clone this repo

1. Check the version of USWDS in `package.json` — update to the newest version if necessary, and sync its new files to the theme.

   > `rake update`

1. Start Jekyll to preview the effects of your changes. This will build the Jekyll site, watch the Sass files, and recompile the Sass when there are changes.

   > `npm start`

   **or**

   Create a new Jekyll project, follow the
   [installation](#installation) instructions, then change your
   `Gemfile` to point at the local clone of this repo:

   ```ruby
   gem 'uswds-jekyll', :path => '../path/to/uswds-jekyll'
   ```

### Publish to Rubygems

1. Update `spec.version = "NUMBER HERE"` in the uswds-jekyll.gemspec file to the version you want to publish
1. Run `bundle install`
1. Add a PR for the update and get it merged
1. Run `bundle exec rake release`
1. Add a GitHub release to the releases page with the same version number
1. You should see the latest version here https://rubygems.org/gems/uswds-jekyll

#### Scripts

- `start`: Starts the jekyll site
- `setup-uswds`: Copies assets from the USWDS package to their theme locations, but running the following scipts, which can also be run separately:
  - `sync-assets`: Copies assets to `assets/uswds`
  - `sync-sass`: Copies Sass cource files to `_sass/uswds/src/`
  - `sync-default-settings`: Copies default settings files to `_sass/uswds/settings`
  - `sync-theme-settings`: Copies only theme settings files to `_sass/settings`
