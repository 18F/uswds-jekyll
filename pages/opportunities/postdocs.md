The  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) SCINet and AI Center of Excellence offer exciting collaborative research opportunities to motivated participants interested in solving agricultural-natural resource related problems. One of the goals of the ORISE Fellowship program is to develop and apply new and emerging technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Many of these questions rely on the synthesis, integration, and analysis of large,  diverse datasets that benefit from high performance computers (HPC) or a cloud computing environment. Fellows will have the opportunity to collaboration on problems of high priority to the USDA ARS, while being trained across a range of skills including AI, machine learning, deep learning, data science, and/or statistical software as needed for the success of the position.

**About the USDA ARS:** The ARS mission involves problem-solving research in the widely diverse food and agricultural areas encompassing plant production and protection; animal production and protection; natural resources and sustainable agricultural systems; and nutrition; food safety and quality. The programs are conducted in 46 of the 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Programs are also carried out in cooperation with several foreign countries. For ARS to maintain its standing as a premier scientific organization, major investments in computing, networking, and storage infrastructure are required as well as trained scientific personnel. Training in data and information management are integral to the integrity, security, and accessibility of research findings, results, and outcomes within the ARS research enterprise. USDA ARS Chief Science Information Officer, Dr. Debra Peters (ARS-CSIO at usda dot gov) can be contacted for additional information.
