## Overview

The SCINet Program in collaboration with the Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence (AI-COE) will be providing funding to support postdoctoral fellows mentored by ARS scientists.  Each Fellow funded through the ORISE Program is expected to:
1. be involved in individual and collaborative, multi-unit research
1. be provided with training and leadership opportunities
1. contribute to the overall success of SCNet or the AI COE, and the Fellows Program.

We expect to fund up to 15 2-year Fellows (with a possible 3rd year extension) in FY22. Each fellow will receive the same stipend and travel support through the ORISE Program. The mentor is expected to provide the Fellowâ€™s laptop, and office and laboratory space, if needed.
 
SCINet fellows are expected to be involved in the analysis of complex, large datasets requiring the use of one of the ARS' high performance computing clusters (HPCs: Ceres or Atlas). AI-COE fellows will have the development or use of AI technologies as a key component of their individual or collaborative research. See below for definition of these technologies.
 
Proposals are due December 17, 2021. Please note the RL or supervisor needs to approve the proposal before submission in order to be considered for funding. Only one proposal is allowed from each scientist. Mentors of successful proposals will have ca. 15 months to onboard a Fellow (by 1 June 2023) before the funds are returned to SCINet or the AI-COE.

**Eligibility:** ARS Category 1 or 4 scientists with RL or supervisor approval.


## Proposal submission

ARS scientists who would like to be considered as a mentor for either a SCINet or AI-COE Fellow should submit proposals to [https://forms.office.com/g/PngLtErC4k](https://forms.office.com/g/PngLtErC4k). Be sure to answer all of the questions to be considered for funding. After the form is submitted, the mentor and approving RL or supervisor will receive an email confirming submission.

For questions, contact Dr. Debra Peters, CSIO (ARS-CSIO@usda.gov).
 
 
## Definition of AI/ML technologies

(These are examples and not inclusive of all possible methods and tools.)
 
_AI methods_ involve automated decision-making or inference from data, and use methods in the subfields:
* machine learning (including deep learning)
* mathematical optimization (integer programming and operations research)
* machine reasoning and logic programming (not normal computer programming)
* knowledge representation
* recommender systems

_Machine learning_ involves training a model with data, and then making decisions or answering questions using that model. ML methods include:
* tasks like classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, and clustering;
* domain areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and time-series analyses;
* statistical methods like gaussian processes, neural networks, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines.
