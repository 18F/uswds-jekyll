Fellows funded by SCINet or the AI Center of Excellence through the ORISE Program bring a fresh perspective to the ARS scientist community, while allowing these Fellows to learn through hands-on research under our top scientists. These Fellows are funded for two year terms with the goal to support unit and collaborative research using high performance computing and computational science skills. 

*The SCINet and AI COE Fellows Conference 2021 will be held on November 9-10.*
