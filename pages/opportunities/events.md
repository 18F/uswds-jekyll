The SCINet initiative is planning to host a number of virtual training/workshop events in the coming months for USDA ARS scientists and collaborators. Information on how to attend these events will be posted on this page closer to the event date. 

**Event** | **Date** | **Time** | **Location** | **How to Participate**
---|---|---|---|---|
Workshop: Leveraging advances in data science to manage and conserve pollinators | 8/26-8/27/2021 | 10:30-5:00pm ET | Virtual | The workshop will address applications of data science methods to pollinator research in four thematic sessions: 1) monitoring wild-bee communities, 2) using remote sensing to quantify floral resources, 3) genomics and molecular methods in pollinator research, and 4) digital infrastructure for long-term monitoring of honey bees. Within these themes, research talks from ARS scientists and collaborators will be followed by breakout discussion sessions.

The deadline to register is 8/13/2021|
Introduction to Image Processing and Classical Machine Learning | 8/9-8/10/2021 | 10:00-4:00pm CT | Virtual | This two-day workshop will cover the basics of image processing and classical machine learning using Python. Participants will be introduced to the basic concepts via PowerPoint lecture and guided through hands-on programming in an interactive Jupyter notebook framework. Participants will be encouraged to actively modify and expand the provided python code. Topics in image processing will include the basics of image processing, including conventions of image representation and image manipulations. Topics in classical machine learning will include the basics of feature extraction and labels; training, testing, and validation; and common methods for image classification. Topics in deep learning will include the basics of convolutional neural networks; training, testing, and validation in deep learning; and transfer learning. [Register here](http://msuext.ms/ars) to attend the workshop. |
Advanced Topics in Deep Learning | 8/11-8/13/2021 | 10:00-4:00pm CT | Virtual | This three-day workshop will provide more in-depth exploration of some common deep learning architectures used in image processing. Participants will be introduced to the basic concepts via PowerPoint lecture and guided through hands-on programming in an interactive Jupyter notebook framework. Participants will be encouraged to actively modify and expand the provided python code. The first day will cover methods to explore, visualize, and modify network architectures. The second day will cover extensions to the convolutional neural network for such tasks as image segmentation, object detection, and spatio-temporal analysis.
