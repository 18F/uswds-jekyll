---|---|---|---|---|
Workshop: Leveraging advances in data science to manage and conserve pollinators | 8/26-8/27/2021 | 10:30-5:00pm ET | Virtual | The workshop will address applications of data science methods to pollinator research in four thematic sessions: 1) monitoring wild-bee communities, 2) using remote sensing to quantify floral resources, 3) genomics and molecular methods in pollinator research, and 4) digital infrastructure for long-term monitoring of honey bees. Within these themes, research talks from ARS scientists and collaborators will be followed by breakout discussion sessions.

Introduction to Atlas | 8/26 | 2:00- 3:30PM CT | Virtual | This 90-mintue information session is for anyone interested in learning more about USDA’s new state-of-the art supercomputer Atlas.  Atlas is a high-performance computer with 101 terabytes of total RAM designed to help power research advances in biocomputing, epidemiology, geospatial technology and more.  This introduction will cover a range of topics that include everything from a general overview of high-performance computing and why you might want to take advantage of its capabilities in your research to basic protocols associated with using Atlas (how to gain access to Atlas, how to log-in to your account, how to transfer data, etc.).   This introduction session will be led by Dr. Adam Thrash, MSU Research Associate and Computer Specialist with MSU’s Institute of Genomics, Biocomputing, and Biotechnology. [Register here](http://msuext.ms/ars). Note that you will need to create an account with Miss St Extension if you do not already have one to register for the event.|
