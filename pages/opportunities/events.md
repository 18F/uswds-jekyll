The SCINet initiative is planning to host a number of virtual training/workshop events in the coming months for USDA ARS scientists and collaborators. Information on how to attend these events will be posted on this page closer to the event date.

Blockchain Workshop | 7/6/2021 | 2:00-3:30pm CST | Virtual | This 2-day workshop will provide a comprehensive introduction to blockchain networks (BCN). A BCN is a valuable platform for improving public confidence in data driven decisions/policies. It can be viewed as a computer that is capable of executing algorithms that process data and output results. However, the manner in which a BCN executes algorithms is substantially different from that of a general purpose computer. Some understanding of how BCNs work is necessary to rethink algorithms suitable for BCN execution. This workshop is intended for anyone who wants to learn more about BCNs and the necessary steps needed to take advantage of them. Topics covered in this workshop will include: A history of data processing, to answer the question “why do we need BCNs?”; A brief introduction to some useful concepts (hash functions and digital signatures) in cryptography, that are essential for understanding how BCNs work; Gradual development of the idea of BCNs (from cryptography to timestamping services to BCNs); Different types of BCNs, and their pros and cons; Implications on algorithms.

Introduction to Atlas | 7/15/2021 | 10-11:30am CST | Virtual | This 90-minute information session is for anyone interested in learning more about USDA’s new state-of-the art supercomputer Atlas. Atlas is a high-performance computer with 101 terabytes of total RAM designed to help power research advances in biocomputing, epidemiology, geospatial technology and more. This introduction will cover a range of topics that include everything from a general overview of high-performance computing and why you might want to take advantage of its capabilities in your research to basic protocols associated with using Atlas (how to gain access to Atlas, how to log-in to your account, how to transfer data, etc.). This introduction session will be lead by Dr. Adam Thrash, MSU Research Associate and Computer Specialist with MSU’s Institute of Genomics, Biocomputing, and Biotechnology.
