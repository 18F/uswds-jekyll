---|---|---|---|---|
UAS Workshop II: Missions, Operations, and Planning | 5/13/2021 | 1:30-4:30pm CST | Virtual | For research pilots of sUAS: an overview of vehicle types, regulations, operations planning, flight skill and currency requirements, and reporting.  Ensure your organization is prepared to take to the skies quickly, safely, and with a sound approach to gathering research data. Registration capped at 30 participants. Familiarity with the material in UAS Workshop I is expected. You can [watch the Workshop I training video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/ab74daf3-9151-4a4e-b78b-eea25729bc40) on the REE-ARS-SCINet-Media MS Stream Channel (must eAuthenticate to access).

Data Wrangling Workshop | 5/27/2021 | 10-12pm CST | Virtual | This workshop will briefly touch on various common unmanned aerial system (UAS) payloads such as RGB and multispectral imagers, hyperspectral sensors, and LIDAR. It will then provide an overview of how photogrammetry works with RGB/multispectral imagery. A sample processing flow will be demonstrated in two of the popular commercial photogrammetry suites, Agisoft Metashape and Pix4D Pix4Dmapper, producing a reflectance-corrected and georeferenced orthomosaic from each software suite.
