The SCINet initiative is planning to host a number of virtual training/workshop events in the coming months for USDA ARS scientists and collaborators. Information on how to attend these events will be posted on this page closer to the event date. 

|**Event** | **Date** | **Time** | **Location** | **How to Participate** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|SCINet-AI COE Fellows Conference | 9-10 Nov 2021 | 9:30-4:30 ET | Zoom | For more information, email scinet-training@usda.gov.  Learn more at [https://scinet.usda.gov/opportunities/fellowsconference](https://scinet.usda.gov/opportunities/fellowsconference) |
|Command Line Skills for Scientific Computing- Command-line skills are invaluable for a wide range of modern data science and analysis tasks, from data acquisition and processing to high-performance computing.  This 3-hour workshop will help you learn how to use the Unix command line with plenty of hands-on practice in a supportive environment.  Who should take this course?  Anyone who wants to learn how to use the Unix command line!  There are no skills prerequisites, but you will need access to a Unix shell.  Ideally, this would be on one of our HPC systems, so if you attend Parts 1 and 2 of the SCINet HPC series, you will be ready to go.| 17 Nov 2021 | 2:00-5:00 ET | Zoom | Learn more or register at [https://forms.office.com/g/QFZskTMj1C](https://forms.office.com/g/QFZskTMj1C) |

### Recurring Events

**Introduction to Atlas**

This 90-minute information session is for anyone interested in learning more about USDA’s new state-of-the art supercomputer Atlas. Atlas is a high-performance computer with 101 terabytes of total RAM designed to help power research advances in biocomputing, epidemiology, geospatial technology and more. This introduction will cover a range of topics including a general overview of high-performance computing, why you might want to take advantage of its capabilities in your research, and basic protocols associated with using Atlas (how to gain access to Atlas, how to log-in to your account, how to transfer data, etc.). This introduction session will be led by Dr. Adam Thrash, MSU Research Associate and Computer Specialist with MSU’s Institute of Genomics, Biocomputing, and Biotechnology.
