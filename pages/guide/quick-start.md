# What is SCINet

SCINet is the name for the USDA-ARS initiative for scientific computing. It consists of:

1. High performance computer clusters for running command-line and graphical programs. There are currently two clusters: Ceres cluster in Ames IA and Atlas cluster in Starkville MS. Another cluster at NAL in Beltsville MD will be coming online later this year. SCINet also offers AWS cloud computing. See [SCINet HPC Systems](/about/compute) for more detail.
2. Network improvements across ARS.
3. Support for computing through the Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC). See [VRSC Support](/support/vrsc/) for more detail.
4. Training and workshop opportunities in multiple areas of scientific computing. See [Upcoming Events](/opportunities/events) and [Past Workshops](/workshops/) for more detail.

# Set Up Multi-Factor Authentication

For security, SCINet requires multifactor authentication. See the setup instructions in the [Multi-Factor Authentication User Guide](/guide/multifactor/).


# HPC Clusters on SCINet

Cluster name | Location | Login Nodes | Transfer Nodes
-------------|----------|-------------|---------------
Ceres        |Ames, IA  |ceres.scinet.usda.gov | ceres-dtn.scinet.usda.gov
Atlas        |Starkville, MS| atlas-login.hpc.msstate.edu |atlas-dtn.hpc.msstate.edu
TBD          |Beltsville, MD| TBD|TBD

# Accessing SCINet

All users should have received their login credentials in an email.  If you have not, please email the Virtual Research Support Core at [scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV](mailto:scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV?subject=account%20access)

## From Windows 10

Windows 10 that is up to date has an ssh client in the Windows Power Shell. To use that client, click on the Start button and start typing "power". Select Windows PowerShell from the list. In the PowerShell window you can simply type
```
ssh <user.name>@ceres.scinet.usda.gov
```
to login to Ceres and
```
ssh <user.name>@atlas-login.hpc.msstate.edu
```
to login to Atlas.

However we recommend creating a config file as described in the instructions for Mac and Linux in the next section. To create config file in `C: > Users > (your account) > .ssh` on your Windows 10 computer use Notepad. Make sure to save file with no extension (simply `config` and not `config.txt`). If you don't want to use config file, you can manually type longer ssh command described in the instructions for Mac and Linux below. The `-o` option is not required but helps to keep ssh connection alive. 

After typing ssh command, enter the 6-digit code generated by the Google Authenticator app when prompted for Verification code. Note that when you type the code or the password, nothing will be shown on the screen. If system accepts the code it will prompt you for password. If you made a mistake when typing 6-digit code, and are prompted for Verification code once again, wait for the new code to be generated.

If your password has expired (new temporary passwords expire right away, and the passwords set by users expire after 60 days) you will be prompted to change your password. Note that when changing password, first you will need to enter the same password that you used to login, and only when prompted for a new password, you will enter a new one.

## From Older Windows Versions

1. Please download [Putty.exe](https://www.putty.org/)
2. Start PuTTY
3. In the left-hand menu select the 'Session' category, then on the right side type into the 'Host Name' either `ceres.scinet.usda.gov` (for Ceres connections) or `atlas-login.hpc.msstate.edu` (for Atlas connections).
4. In the left-hand menu select the 'Connection' category, then on the right side replace `0` with `60` for "Seconds between keepalives" and check the "Enable TCP keepalives"
5. In the left-hand menu select “Data” category under the ‘Connection’ category and type your username on the right side
6. To save these settings for later logins select the 'Session' category, and in the “Saved Sessions” type `SCINet Ceres` or `SCINet Atlas`, then click on “Save” button.
7. Hit "Open"
8. Enter the 6-digit code generated by the Google Authenticator app when prompted for Verification code. Note that when you type the code or the password, nothing will be shown on the screen. If system accepts the code it will prompt you for password. If you made a mistake when typing 6-digit code, and are prompted for Verification code once again, wait for the new code to be generated.
9. If your password has expired (new temporary passwords expire right away, and the passwords set by users expire after 90 days) you will be prompted to change your password. Note that when changing password, first you will need to enter the same password that you used to login, and only when prompted for a new password, you will enter a new one.

## From Mac and Linux

Open a terminal window. We recommend setting up a config file to make logging in easier and use settings to provide a more stable connection.

Create a ~/.ssh/config entry similar to this:
```bash
Host ceres-login
HostName ceres.scinet.usda.gov
User <user.name>
TCPKeepAlive yes
ServerAliveInterval 20
ServerAliveCountMax 30

Host atlas-login
HostName atlas-login.hpc.msstate.edu
User <user.name>
TCPKeepAlive yes
ServerAliveInterval 20
ServerAliveCountMax 30
```

That will send a "keepalive" signal every 20 seconds and keep retrying for up to 30 failures. This also simplifies your login to just:

`ssh ceres-login`
or
`ssh atlas-login`

If you don't want to use the config file method you can just add these options to the ssh command:
```bash
ssh -o TCPKeepAlive=yes -o ServerAliveInterval=20 -o ServerAliveCountMax=30 <user.name>@ceres.scinet.usda.gov
``` 
and
```bash
ssh -o TCPKeepAlive=yes -o ServerAliveInterval=20 -o ServerAliveCountMax=30 <user.name>@atlas-login.hpc.msstate.edu
``` 

After typing ssh command, enter the 6-digit code generated by the Google Authenticator app when prompted for Verification code. Note that when you type the code or the password, nothing will be shown on the screen. If system accepts the code it will prompt you for password. If you made a mistake when typing 6-digit code, and are prompted for Verification code once again, wait for the new code to be generated.

If your password has expired (new temporary passwords expire right away, and the passwords set by users expire after 60 days) you will be prompted to change your password. Note that when changing password, first you will need to enter the same password that you used to login, and only when prompted for a new password, you will enter a new one.


# Password Requirements

1. AT LEAST 12 characters long
2. AT LEAST 3 different character classes:[lower case letters, upper case letters, digits, symbols]
3. Different from the expired password: at least 5 character changes (inserts, removals, or replacements) are required
4. difficult to guess or brute force. Palindromes, passwords containing your username, and other patterns will be denied.
5. Older passwords CAN NOT be reused.


# Data Storage

There are multiple places to store data persistently on SCINet clusters. For more information about storage options, refer to [SCINet Storage Guide](/guide/storage).

Storage | Path
--------|-----
HOME | /home/user.name
PROJECT | /project
KEEP (on Ceres only) | /keep
--------|------

## Quotas
Home and project directories have quotas. Current usage and quotas for home and project directories that user belongs to are displayed at login. The `my_quotas` command provides the same information.

## Home Directories

Home directories are private, they are only accessible to you and the system administrators. When a user logs into Ceres, they are automatically logged into their home directory. Home directories have small quotas and should be mainly used for configuration and login files. Computations should be run from project directories. Files in home directories are automatically compressed and backed up. Due to backup method used on Ceres, space freed after deleting files in home directories, will become available only after 6 days.

## Project Directories

Project directories are intended as high-level workspaces. This is where large datasets would reside, sub-projects can be created, and collaborative analysis results stored. Project directories are usually associated with ARS Research Projects.

To request a new project directory see [Request Project Storage](/support/request-storage). A direct link to the form (eAuthentication required) which includes submitting a Data Management Plan:

[Request a project directory](https://e.arsnet.usda.gov/sites/OCIO/scinet/accounts/SitePages/Project_Allocation_Request.aspx){: .usa-button }

Users may not need to request a new project directory if they're working with someone who already has a project directory. Instead the manager of the existing project directory will need to request access to the project directory for additional users by emailing [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](mailto:scinet_vrsc@usda.gov?subject=add%20to%20project)

Directories in `/project` are not backed up, however users can copy important data from a directory in `/project` to a corresponding directory in `/KEEP` on Ceres that is backed up nightly. It is not recommended to run jobs from a directory in `/KEEP`.


# Data Transfer

Given the space and access limitations of a home directory, large amounts of data or data that will be used collaboratively should be transferred to a project directory. If you have issues with transferring data, please contact [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](mailto:scinet_vrsc@usda.gov?subject=data%20transfer%20enquiry).

## Globus Data Transfers

We recommend using Globus Online to transfer data to and from Ceres cluster. It provides faster data transfer speeds compared to scp, has graphical interface and does not require to enter GA verification code for every file transfer. To transfer data to/from a local computer, users will need to install Globus Personal which does NOT require admin privileges. More information about Globus Online for SCINet clusters can be found in the [Transferring Files User Guide](/guide/file-transfer).

## Small Data Transfers

While Globus is faster, you can also transfer data from your local machine to SCINet clusters using the scp command (the destination filenames are optional). It is recommended to transfer large files into your project directory (due to the limited space of home directories). Smaller files can be transferred to/from your home directory by replacing  `/project/yourproject`  in the examples below with  `~`

Transfer a file to your SCINet project directory:
```bash
scp yourfile sally.doe@ceres-dtn.scinet.usda.gov:/project/yourproject
```
or
```bash
scp yourfile sally.doe@atlas-dtn.hpc.msstate.edu:/project/yourproject
```

Transfer a file from your SCINet project directory:
```bash
scp sally.doe@ceres-dtn.scinet.usda.gov:/project/yourproject/yourfile .
```
or
```bash
scp sally.doe@atlas-dtn.hpc.msstate.edu:/project/yourproject/yourfile .
```

To transfer an entire directory, you can use the -r option with any one of the above commands and specify a directory to transfer.  All of the files in that directory will get transferred, for example:
```bash
scp -r sequence_files sally.doe@ceres-dtn.scinet.usda.gov:/project/yourproject
```
or
```bash
scp -r sequence_files sally.doe@atlas-dtn.hpc.msstate.edu:/project/yourproject
```

You can view the full set of options and their descriptions by typing `man scp`

Other options for small data transfers include [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) and [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).

## Shipping Hard Drives

You can send hard drives containing data to the VRSC if you have very large amounts of data (typically greater than 50GB) to transfer to Ceres or if the network speed at your location is slow. Please follow the instructions for shipping hard drives in the [Transferring Files Guide](/guide/file-transfer/#large-data-transfer-by-shipping-hard-drives).


# Tools and Software

## Available Software

Many software applications are available as modules; see [Software Overview](/guide/software) or type `module avail` on a cluster to see them.  Users can load the modules that they need to do their analysis.  We manage applications as modules to enable different versions of different applications to exist simulatneously and to be easily managed.

The `module` command is used to work with the different software application modules. The following table lists some of the most common functions of the `module` command:

Command |	Description
---|---
`module avail`  or  `module spider`	| List the modules that are available
`module list`	| List the modules that are currently loaded
`module unload <module name>`	| Remove <module name> from the environment
`module load <module name>`	| Load <module name> into the environment
`module swap <module one> <module two>`	| Replace <module one> with <module two> in the environment
`module -h`	| Lists the full help menu for the module command
----|----

## Reference Genome Assemblies

The reference genome sequences of many agricultural species are stored in a central location to free space in user’s home and project directories. 
FASTA files of the sequences and associated index files for popular alignment tools (BLAST, SAMTools, BWA, Bowtie2, etc.) can be found in `/reference/data/XX/`.   

Additional sequences and index files can be added to the shared directory by contacting the Virtual Research Support Core at [scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV](mailto:scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV?subject=reference%20data)

## Text Editors
The following are a few of the common text editors that are available on the system:
`vi`, `emacs`, `nano`.

# Running Applications

The login node is meant to be used for setting up analysis and tasks that are not computationally or memory intensive.
If your job runs for longer than a few minutes then please use the interactive mode or batch mode described below.

SCINet clusters use SLURM as the job scheduler. It is similar to SGE and PBS.

## Compute Nodes

There are different queues or partitions on the clusters. You will specify a queue when submitting batch jobs.

Main partitions on Ceres are listed in the table below:

Name |	Nodes	|Maximum Run Time	|Function
---|---|---|---
short	|100	|48 hours|	default queue, for short runs
medium|	68|	7 days	|for medium-length runs
long	|35|	21 days |	for long runs
mem	|8|	7 days|	for applications requiring high memory
longmem|	1|	1000 hours	|for high memory applications requiring more than a week
debug|	1|	1 hour	|for testing
---|---|---|---

To learn about other partitions on Ceres, refer to [Ceres User Manual](/guide/ceres/#partitions-or-queues).

To get current details on all partitions on a cluster use the following scontrol command:
```bash
scontrol show partitions
```

At most 400 cores and 1512 GB of memory can be used by all simultaneously running jobs per user across all queues. Any additional jobs will be queued but won't start.

## Interactive Mode

From the Ceres login node, request an interactive session by typing `salloc`

Now you are running interactively on a single hyper-threaded core (2 logical cores) with 6200 MB of allocated memory on one of the compute nodes. The session will last for 2 days, but will timeout after 1.5 hours of inactivity (no commands runnning).

You can view and load modules for the applications you need, and execute applications from the command-line.

When complete, return to the login node by typing `exit`

For more fine grained control over the interactive environment you can use the srun command. Issue the srun command from a login node of a SCINet cluster. Command syntax is:

`srun --pty -p queue -t hh:mm:ss -A account -n tasks -N nodes /bin/bash -l`

account is either scinet on Ceres or your project name on Atlas. For example if your project directory is at /project/projectname, then specify "-A projectname" on the srun command.

See the [Ceres User Manual](/guide/ceres/#running-application-jobs-on-compute-nodes) for details on `srun`.

## Batch Mode

You can run jobs on the cluster by writing short scripts that will get executed on the cluster. For more details about running jobs in batch mode, please see the detailed [Ceres User Manual](/guide/ceres/#batch-mode).

Here is an example of a batch job submission bash script (e.g. `blast_job.sh`, for running BLAST):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="blastp" #name of the job submitted
#SBATCH -p short #name of the queue you are submitting job to
#SBATCH -N 1 #number of nodes in this job
#SBATCH -n 40 #number of cores/tasks in this job, you get all 20 cores with 2 threads per core with hyperthreading
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00 #time allocated for this job hours:mins:seconds
#SBATCH -A projectname  #substitute with the name of your project
#SBATCH --mail-user=emailAddress #enter your email address to receive emails
#SBATCH --mail-type=BEGIN,END,FAIL #will receive an email when job starts, ends or fails
#SBATCH -o "stdout.%j.%N" # standard out %j adds job number to outputfile name and %N adds the node name
#SBATCH -e "stderr.%j.%N" #optional but it prints our standard error
date #optional this command prints out timestamp when the job is starting in stdout file
module load blast+    #loading latest NCBI BLAST+ module
blastp -db nr -query blastInputs -out blastout # protein blast search against nr database
date #optional printing out timestamp when the job ends
```

You would submit the script by typing: `sbatch blast_job.sh`

## Job Script Generator

You can also use Ceres Job Script Generator to generate job scripts.

[Ceres Job Script Generator](/support/ceres-job-script){: .usa-button }

## Useful SLURM Commands

Command	|Description	|Examples
---|---|---
`squeue`	|Gives information about jobs	|`squeue` or `squeue -u jane.webb`
`scancel`	|Stop and remove jobs|	`scancel 1256` or `scancel -u jane.webb`
`sinfo`	|Gives information about queues (partitions) or nodes	|`sinfo` or `sinfo -N -l`


# Building Your Own Tools

Users can build and use their own tools. It is recommended to compile on compute nodes, and not on the login node. 
In addition, since home directories have a small quota, it is recommended to install software, 
such as Python, Perl, R packages and conda virtual environments in `/KEEP/project_name`. 
The [Conda Guide](https://scinet.usda.gov/guide/conda/#example-2-installing-tensorflow-into-a-keep-directory) provides instructions 
on how to install conda virtual environments in `/KEEP`, while 
[Guide to Installing R, Python, and Perl Packages](https://scinet.usda.gov/guide/packageinstall/) has examples of
installing packages in a project directory.
