# Introduction
[Open OnDemand](https://openondemand.org/) is an intuitive, innovative, and interactive interface to remote computing resources. The key benefit for SCINet users is that they can use any web browser, including browsers on a mobile phone, to access Ceres.

# Access
To access Open OnDemand on the Ceres cluster, go to [Ceres OpenOndemand](http://ceres-ood.scinet.usda.gov/)
