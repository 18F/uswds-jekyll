When a user applies for a SCINet account, they are allocated space on Ceres in a /home directory. Each user is allowed 5GB of data in the home directory. 

Users are advised to request additional space in the /project directory. Project directory storage is large, fast, not backed up, and can be requested up to 1TB or larger if justified. Project directory storage is good for fast I/O to large data files from compute nodes. The new project requests and request for changes must be submitted by the ARS projectâ€™s Principal Investigator (PI). 

## To Modify an Existing SCINet Project Allocation
The PI should send an email that includes:
* the name of the project directory (/project/\<projectname>/) and 
* the requested changes 

to the SCINet Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC) [scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV](mailto:scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV?subject=modify%20project%20allocation).

## To Request a Quota Increase for an Existing SCINet Project Allocation
SCINet users have access to a large short-term storage /90daydata which has no quotas. When requesting a project quota increase on Ceres or Atlas the PI will need to justify the request and explain why using /90daydata is not sufficient. 

To request project quota increase for storage on Ceres, Atlas and/or Juno fill out the following application form:

[Request Project Quota Increase](https://forms.office.com/g/ntnKBzJiKx){: .usa-button .usa-button-big }

Please Note: Only the project manager or the project PI can request a quota increase. Any requests sent by other individuals will be declined.

## To Request a New Project Allocation
When requesting additional data storage you will be asked for:
* a project summary, 
* project end date, 
* and to detail your long-term plan for data in your project directory after your project end date.

To request a new project directory, fill out an application form (eAuthentication required, non-ARS users should contact their sponsor):
[Request Project Storage](https://e.arsnet.usda.gov/sites/OCIO/scinet/accounts/SitePages/Project_Allocation_Request.aspx){: .usa-button .usa-button-big }
