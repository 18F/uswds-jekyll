When a user applies for a SCINet account, they are allocated space on Ceres in a /home directory. Each user is allowed 5GB of data in the home directory. 

Users are advised to request additional space in the /project directory. Project directory storage is large, fast, not backed up, and can be requested up to 1TB or larger if justified. Project directory storage is good for fast I/O to large data files from compute nodes. It is not recommended to run jobs from a directory in /KEEP .

## To Modify an Existing SCINet Project Allocation
Send an email that includes:
* the name of the project directory (/project/\<projectname>/) and 
* the requested changes 

to the SCINet Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC) [scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV](mailto:scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV?subject=modify%20project%20allocation).

## To Request a New Project Allocation
When requesting additional data storage you will be asked for:
* a project summary, 
* project end date, 
* and to detail your long-term plan for data in your project directory after your project end date.

To request more storage (new project directory), fill out an application form (eAuthentication required, non-ARS users should contact their sponsor):
[Request Project Storage](https://e.arsnet.usda.gov/sites/OCIO/scinet/accounts/SitePages/Project_Allocation_Request.aspx){: .usa-button .usa-button-big }
