## Before sending VRSC a software request do the following:

1. Make sure the software isn't already available as a module by checking the lists of module software on the [Software Overview](/guide/software) page.

   If you only need a different version of a software package that is already installed on CERES please email [scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV](mailto:scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV?subject=software%20request%20-%20add%20different%20version).

2. Consider whether you should install the software yourself in your home or project directory - see the [Software Overview](/guide/software) for more details.

   You may want to use Conda for package, dependency, and environment management- see this [guide about how to use conda on SCINet](/guide/conda).

   If you're not sure whether you should install software yourself or if you need help, email [scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV](mailto:scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV?subject=help%20with%20software). Software that will be useful to many SCINet users should be installed as a module by the VRSC.


## How to send a software request
If you've done the above but need new software installed as a module, use the software request form (eAuthentication required, non-ARS users should contact their sponsor):

[Software Request Form](https://e.arsnet.usda.gov/sites/OCIO/scinet/Pages/SCINet-New-Application.aspx){: .usa-button .usa-button-big }

**Note: doing this requires an agency-level security review and takes a few weeks.**
