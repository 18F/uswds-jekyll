The Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC) is comprised of ARS personnel and contract personnel at Iowa State University. The VRSC manages the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the Ceres HPC system and is also involved with the networking aspects of SCINet. The VRSC is staffed by talented IT administrators and engineers with expertise in high-performance computing system and network engineering, operations, maintenance, and administration.

Additionally, the VRSC provides research IT support, computational expertise in various research domains, and support for SCINet-funded workshops/training for SCINet users.

## How and When to Contact the VRSC

Discussion that is relevant to other SCINet users such as questions about the best practices for research computations should be posted on the [SCINet VRSC Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/3625179/projects/5538276) message board. Access to Basecamp is provided during the SCINet account application process ([Apply for an Account](https://usda-ars-gbru.github.io/scinet-site/signup/)).

If your question is related to SCINet policy or development, contact the acting SCINet Program Manager, Stan Kosecki.

Single user operational questions, including Galaxy questions, should be emailed to the VRSC scinet_vrsc@usda.gov, for example:

* I can’t login
* I’m having problems with a batch script
* I’m have a problem with storage
* How do I use software package X?
* Please update software application X on Ceres.
* Please add user X to project Y.
