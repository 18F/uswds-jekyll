SCINet website development, led by Adam Rivers, started in 2019 to create this centralized website for the SCINet Scientific Computing Initiative. The developers are a small team of ARS scientists who manage/solicit content and respond to site feedback with input from the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC; [see FAQ's: What is the Scientific Advisory Committee?](/support/faq/#what-is-the-scientific-advisory-committee-sac)). The SCINet website developers are currently working to expand site content, especially science tutorials, user guides, and news. If you would like to contribute to SCINet website development, contact Moe Richert.
