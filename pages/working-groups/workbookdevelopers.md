Andrew Severin of the SCINet Virtual Research Support Core at Iowa State University is the lead for workbook development. Contact Andrew with questions or to get involved.

#### [Bioinformatics Workbook](https://bioinformaticsworkbook.org/)

The bioinformatics workbook has guides and tutorials focused on the genomics and bioinformatics communities, although researchers of all backgrounds can use the workbook for UNIX command line basics, HPC info, project management tips, and data visualization tutorials. For bioinformatics researchers there is also information on experimental design, genome assembly and annotation, RNA sequencing, variant discovery, and more.

#### [Geospatial Research Workbook](https://geospatial.101workbook.org/)

A geospatial research workbook is currently in development and is planning to offer tutorials and guides similar to the bioinformatics workbook, except focused on geospatial research communities such as ecology, hydrology, and remote sensing sciences.
