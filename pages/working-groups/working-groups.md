The SCINet initiative contributes funding to various working groups that use SCINet computational resources for research. The funding is generally used to convene in-person group workshops. There are also two working groups that develop SCINet learning/training materials.


The current working groups are:
* [Ag100Pest Initiative (subgroup of AGR)](/working-groups/ag100pest)
* [Arthropod Genomics Research (AGR) Working Group](/working-groups/arthropods)
