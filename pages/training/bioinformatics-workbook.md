The Bioinformatics Workbook created by Andrew Severin and colleagues at Iowa State University has guides and tutorials extending well beyond the bioinformatics community. Researchers of all backgrounds can use the workbook for UNIX command line basics, HPC info, project management tips, and data visualization tutorials. For bioinformatics researchers there is also information on experimental design, genome assembly and annotation, RNA sequencing, variant discovery, and more.

> "The best way to learn bioinformatics is through examples of real world problems. The Bioinformatics Workbook provides the reader with an in depth understanding of experimental design, data acquisition, data wrangling, data analysis and visualization. This is accomplished through worked out example problem in each of these sections along with one or more advanced problem sets and corresponding solutions. This books assumes that the reader has some knowledge of biology and basic understanding of the Unix command line. However, for the beginner, the appendix contains introductory material and tips/tricks for common bioinformatic problems, that is referred to for more information throughout the book."
