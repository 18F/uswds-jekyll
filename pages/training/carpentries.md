SCINet is excited to sponsor [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/) and [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) courses.

The Carpentries teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. These courses are offered to ARS staff looking to advance their computational skills sets in support of their research. ARS staff and skilled Carpentries instructors will be available during these hands-on trainings to facilitate your learning.
