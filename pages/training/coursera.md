The SCINet Initiative and the AI Center of Excellence are excited to provide a training opportunity through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). This program will provide a limited number of Coursera licenses free to ARS scientists and support staff to complete courses and specializations focused on scientific computing and artificial intelligence over a 3-month period. Successful completion of courses and specializations will result in **widely recognized certificates and credentials**. Note that you should expect to spend 2-3 hours per week on many of these classes, especially for the more advanced courses.

## Programs of Study

The ARS-Coursera portal includes Programs of Study related to scientific computing and artificial intelligence from top-tier institutions. The ARS Programs of Study are actively growing catalogues, and Coursera continues to add classes on a regular basis. ARS employees are *encouraged to request additional courses/specializations* to be added to our portal by sending an email to scinet-training@usda.gov.

**SCINet**: The courses and specializations focus on general computational and data-science skills (course catalogue at: https://www.coursera.org/programs/scinet-program-of-study-a6nd3).

**AI Center of Excellence**: Content in the courses and specializations are varied, ranging from high-level introductory to technical classical machine learning and deep-learning (course catalogue at: https://www.coursera.org/programs/ai-center-of-excellence-program-of-study-yunri).
