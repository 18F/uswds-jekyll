SCINet and the AI Center of Excellence are excited to provide training opportunities through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). While many Coursera courses can be [audited for free](https://scinet.usda.gov/training/free-online-training#coursera-and-edx), ARS scientists and support staff can gain free access to a wider range of courses by applying for a 3-month SCINet-sponsored license. Successful completion of courses and specializations may result in **widely recognized certificates and credentials**. 

## Programs of Study

The ARS-Coursera portal includes Programs of Study related to scientific computing and artificial intelligence from top-tier institutions. The ARS Programs of Study are actively growing catalogues, and Coursera continues to add classes on a regular basis. ARS employees are *encouraged to request additional courses/specializations* to be added to our portal by sending an email to scinet-training@usda.gov. Note that you should expect to spend 2-3 hours per week on many of these classes, especially for the more advanced courses. 

[**SCINet Program of Study**](https://www.coursera.org/programs/scinet-program-of-study-a6nd3): The courses and specializations included in this program of study focus on general computational and data-science skills. Additional course collections cover topics such as nutrition and climate science. 

[**AI Center of Excellence Program of Study**](https://www.coursera.org/programs/ai-center-of-excellence-program-of-study-yunri): The courses and specializations in this program of study are varied, ranging from high-level introductory to technical classical machine learning and deep-learning.
