# How to Access Training on Different Platforms

In addition to the training resources list on this page, take a look at the [Science Tutorials page](/training/tutorials/) where ARS researchers and the Virtual Research Support Core post their own computational tutorials and training.

### AgLearn and LinkedIn Learning

All federal USDA permanent and term employees should be able to access the AgLearn courses listed on this page by following the posted links. This includes LinkedIn Learning courses.

Non-federal USDA employees (contractors) do not have access to many of the courses in AgLearn, despite being able to login to AgLearn with their PIV card/eAuthentication. Contractors may be given access to AgLearn courses on a case-by-case basis, but it is not guaranteed, due to licensing restrictions. Please have your supervisor contact your Agency [AgLearn Point of Contact](https://usda.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1705/) and provide a justification stating how a particular training will help the researcher carry out the mission of the agency.

For non-federal USDA employees, an exception to the above is AgLearn/LinkedIn Learning. Non-federal USDA employees may be able to access AgLearn/LinkedIn Learning using the following steps:
1.  Go to aglearn.usda.gov but DO NOT LOG IN
2.  In the "Welcome to AgLearn" pane, click on LinkedIn Learning
3.  Follow the instructions to "access your LinkedIn Learning account directly" by following the link and logging in with your eAuthentication credentials. (Do not log in to AgLearn)
4.  Find any of the AgLearn/LinkedIn trainings listed on this page by typing the title of the course in the LinkedIn Learning search bar.

Contact your Agency [AgLearn Point of Contact](https://usda.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1705/) with further questions about how to access AgLearn courses.


### Coursera.org and EdX.org

Many Coursera and EdX courses can be audited for free (i.e. no certification which requires a fee).

For EdX courses: click enroll on a particular course, create an EdX account, and choose the free audit option.

For Coursera courses: see [https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-signup-for-free/](https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-signup-for-free/) for instructions on how to sign up to audit a Coursera course (for free and without activating the 7-day trial period). Pay special attention how to access courses for free within a specialization and also to pre-requisites for advanced topics.

**SCINet-funded licenses for Coursera and EdX course certificates:** *The SCINet initiative is in the process of purchasing licenses for ARS researchers to obtain course certificates for completed Coursera and EdX courses. If interested in certification for these courses, you may want to wait until you are able to obtain a license. More information will be posted here as soon as it is available.*

### sas.com and jmp.com
While links below to SAS and JMP videos are immediately accessible, SAS and JMP course offerings on sas.com and jmp.com (not the courses offered through AgLearn) require the learner to create a free account with their email address and password.

To start a course on sas.com:  
Follow the link to the course from this page, scroll down the course overview page to the "Self-Paced e-Learning" section, under "Add to Cart" on the right click "Start", follow the instructions to create a profile for a new user.

To start a course on jmp.com:  
Follow the link to the course from this page, from the JMP course page click "Enroll Now", follow the instructions to create a profile for a new user.

### realpython.com
Dan Bader, the owner and editor-in-chief at Real Python, is offering a number of free python training courses during the COVID-19 shut-in period. To access these courses for free go to https://realpython.com/free-courses-march-2020 and use the gift code link that Dan has posted on that page. Please contact Dan Bader at Real Python with questions.
