There are a number of free training resources on scientific computing available to ARS scientists and collaborators. Check out these curated collections of learning resources by topic. 

| Programming Languages | Types of Analyses | Practices |
|---|---|---|
[Git and GitHub](#git-and-github) | [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning](#artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning) | [General Statistics](#general-statistics)
[MATLAB Programming](#matlab-programming) | [Bioinformatics](#bioinformatics-self-paced-learning)| [General Data Science Concepts](#general-data-science-concepts)
[Python Programming](#python-programming) | [Geospatial](#geospatial) | [Reproducibility & Productivity Tools](#reproducibility-productivity-and-integration-management-tools) 
[R Programming](#r-programming) | [Statistics](#general-statistics)| [Integration Management Tools](#reproducibility-productivity-and-integration-management-tools)
[SAS Programming and JMP](#sas-programming-and-jmp) |  

*A big thank you to Sara Duke and Kathy Yeater, Plains Area Statisticians, for assembling the vast majority of the following online training offerings!*

Additionally, SCINet regularly hosts virtual trainings for USDA ARS scientists and collaborators. In addition to the training resources list on this page, take a look at the [SCINet Learning Path](https://scinet.usda.gov/training/learningpath) and the [upcoming training events](https://scinet.usda.gov/training/training_event). 


### How to Access Training on Different Platforms
* [AgLearn and LinkedIn Learning](#aglearn-and-linkedin-learning)
* [Coursera and EdX](#coursera-and-edx)
* [sas.com and jmp.com](#sas-and-jmp)
* [realpython.com](#realpython)

### AgLearn and LinkedIn Learning

AgLearn hosts multiple free learning courses and learning platforms including LinkedIn Learning and Skillsoft Percipio. SCINet has created a number of collections and learning paths to support your learning journey. Login to LinkedIn Learning and and search the keyword SCINet for all curated collections. 

All federal USDA permanent and term employees should be able to access the courses listed on this page by following the posted links. 

Non-federal USDA employees (contractors) do not have access to many of the courses in AgLearn, despite being able to login to AgLearn with their PIV card/eAuthentication. Contractors may be given access to AgLearn courses on a case-by-case basis, but it is not guaranteed, due to licensing restrictions. Please have your supervisor contact your Agency [AgLearn Point of Contact](https://usda.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1705/) and provide a justification stating how a particular training will help the researcher carry out the mission of the agency.
For non-federal USDA employees, an exception to the above is AgLearn/LinkedIn Learning. Non-federal USDA employees may be able to access AgLearn/LinkedIn Learning using the following steps:
1.  Go to aglearn.usda.gov but DO NOT LOG IN
2.  In the "Welcome to AgLearn" pane, click on LinkedIn Learning
3.  Follow the instructions to "access your LinkedIn Learning account directly" by following the link and logging in with your eAuthentication credentials. (Do not log in to AgLearn)
4.  Find any of the AgLearn/LinkedIn trainings listed on this page by typing the title of the course in the LinkedIn Learning search bar.

Contact your Agency [AgLearn Point of Contact](https://usda.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1705/) with further questions about how to access AgLearn courses.


### Coursera and EdX

Many Coursera.org and EdX.org courses can be audited for free (i.e. no certification which requires a fee).

For EdX click enroll on a particular course, create an EdX account, and choose the free audit option.

For Coursera see [the full list of free Coursera courses](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=free). These courses offer a 'Full Course, No Certificate' option. This option lets you see all course materials, submit required assessments, and get a final grade, but does not provide a certificate. 

You also have the option to take some courses in audit mode where you will be able to see most course materials for free but not have access to graded assignments and the ability to earn a Certificate. If you don't see the audit option or you would like a certificate, you can request a [SCINet-sponsored Coursera license](https://scinet.usda.gov/training/coursera), which provides 3-months of full access to Coursera. If you need more than 3 months to complete a course, you will need to resubmit a request for the following quarter to secure your license for another 3 months. 

**SCINet-funded Coursera Licenses:** ARS scientists can request a Coursera license for a three month period to gain access to the full list of Coursera catalogue options related to scientific computing, statistics, and AI. This license also allows ARS scientists to get certifications. To request a license, please visit the [SCINet Coursera page](https://scinet.usda.gov/training/coursera). 

### SAS and JMP
While links below to sas.com and jmp.com videos are immediately accessible, SAS and JMP course offerings on sas.com and jmp.com (not the courses offered through AgLearn) require the learner to create a free account with their email address and password.

To start a course on sas.com:  
Follow the link to the course from this page, scroll down the course overview page to the "Self-Paced e-Learning" section, under "Add to Cart" on the right click "Start", follow the instructions to create a profile for a new user.

To start a course on jmp.com:  
Follow the link to the course from this page, from the JMP course page click "Enroll Now", follow the instructions to create a profile for a new user.

### Realpython
Dan Bader, the owner and editor-in-chief at Real Python, is offering a number of free python training courses during the COVID-19 shut-in period. To access these courses for free go to https://realpython.com/free-courses-march-2020 and use the gift code link that Dan has posted on that page. Please contact Dan Bader at Real Python with questions.
