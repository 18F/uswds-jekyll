The SCINet initiative is planning to host a number of virtual training/workshop events in the coming months for USDA ARS scientists and collaborators. Information on how to attend these events will be posted on this page closer to the event date. 

|**Event** | **Date** | **Time** | **Provider** | **How to Participate** |
|------|------|------|--------|--------|
|Introduction to Atlas- This 90-minute information session is for anyone interested in learning more about USDA’s new state-of-the art supercomputer Atlas. This introduction will cover a range of topics including a general overview of high-performance computing, why you might want to take advantage of its capabilities in your research, and basic protocols associated with using Atlas (how to gain access to Atlas, how to log-in to your account, how to transfer data, etc.). | 15 Dec 2021 | 2:30-3:30 CT | MSU VRSC | To learn more or register, visit [https://forms.office.com/g/rYdpFLxvFV](https://forms.office.com/g/rYdpFLxvFV) |
|Introduction to Image Processing and Classical Machine Learning | 10-11 Jan 2022 | 10:00-4:00 CT | MSU VRSC | To learn more or register, visit [http://msuext.ms/ars](http://msuext.ms/ars) |
|Advanced Topics in Deep Learning | 12-14 Jan 2022 | 10:00-4:00 CT | MSU VRSC | To learn more or register, visit [http://msuext.ms/ars](http://msuext.ms/ars) |
|R Intensive Workshop- Need to get a handle on R? Clueless where to start with the data you have? Learn the basics you will need on your journey in science! | 1/25, 2/1, 2/8, 2/15, and 2/22 | 9:00-12:00 CT| MSU |  To learn more or register, visit [http://msuext.ms/ars](http://msuext.ms/ars) |

|Data Wrangling Workshop- This workshop will briefly touch on various common unmanned aerial system (UAS) payloads such as RGB and multispectral imagers, hyperspectral sensors, and LIDAR. It will then provide an overview of how photogrammetry works with RGB/multispectral imagery. A sample processing flow will be demonstrated in two of the popular commercial photogrammetry suites, Agisoft Metashape and Pix4D Pix4Dmapper, producing a reflectance-corrected and georeferenced orthomosaic from each software suite. | 08 Feb 2022 | 2:30-4:00 CT | MSU VRSC | To learn more or register, visit [https://forms.office.com/g/rYdpFLxvFV](https://forms.office.com/g/rYdpFLxvFV) |
