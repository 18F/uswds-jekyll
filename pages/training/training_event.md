The SCINet initiative is planning to host a number of virtual training/workshop events in the coming months for USDA ARS scientists and collaborators. Information on how to attend these events will be posted on this page closer to the event date. You might want to [take a look at training events we've hosted in the past](/training-archive), too. For information about other SCINet events, please see:
* [Upcoming events](/events/upcoming_events)
* [Past events](/events-archive/)
* [Working group pages](/working-groups) for working group-related events

|**Event** | **Date** | **Time** | **Provider** | **How to Participate** |
|------|------|------|--------|--------|
|R Intensive Workshop- Need to get a handle on R? Clueless where to start with the data you have? Learn the basics you will need on your journey in science! | 1/25, 2/1, 2/8, 2/15, and 2/22 | 9:00-12:00 CT| MSU |  This course is full. To sign up to be notified when it is offered again, visit [https://forms.office.com/g/tVtE8wEgAt](https://forms.office.com/g/tVtE8wEgAt) |
|Data Wrangling Workshop- This workshop will briefly touch on various common unmanned aerial system (UAS) payloads such as RGB and multispectral imagers, hyperspectral sensors, and LIDAR. It will then provide an overview of how photogrammetry works with RGB/multispectral imagery. A sample processing flow will be demonstrated in two of the popular commercial photogrammetry suites, Agisoft Metashape and Pix4D Pix4Dmapper, producing a reflectance-corrected and georeferenced orthomosaic from each software suite. | 08 Feb 2022 | 2:30-4:00 CT | MSU VRSC | To learn more or register, visit [MSU Course Registration](https://reg.extension.msstate.edu/view/cal10a.aspx?ek=&ref=&aa=&sid1=&sid2=&as=81&wp=476&tz=&ms=&nav=&cc=&cat1=&cat2=&cat3=&aid=MSU&rf=&pn=) |
|Data Carpentry (OpenRefine, SQL, Python)- This workshop uses a tabular ecology dataset from the Portal Project Teaching Database and teaches data cleaning, management, analysis, and visualization. There are no pre-requisites, and the materials assume no prior knowledge about the tools. We use a single dataset throughout the workshop to model the data management and analysis workflow that a researcher would use.| 2/16, 2/17, 2/23, 2/24 | 1-5 pm ET | SCINet | To learn more or register, visit  [https://forms.office.com/g/DFn9Kiw05t](https://forms.office.com/g/DFn9Kiw05t) |

|Introduction to Atlas- This 90-minute information session is for anyone interested in learning more about USDA’s new state-of-the art supercomputer Atlas. This introduction will cover a range of topics including a general overview of high-performance computing, why you might want to take advantage of its capabilities in your research, and basic protocols associated with using Atlas (how to gain access to Atlas, how to log-in to your account, how to transfer data, etc.). | 23 Feb 2022 | 10:30-12:00 CT | MSU VRSC | To learn more or register, visit [MSU Course Registration](https://reg.extension.msstate.edu/view/cal10a.aspx?ek=&ref=&aa=&sid1=&sid2=&as=81&wp=476&tz=&ms=&nav=&cc=&cat1=&cat2=&cat3=&aid=MSU&rf=&pn=) |
