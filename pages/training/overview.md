One of SCINet's main objectives is training scientists in computational methods to empower agricultural research. We are doing this in several ways. We offer online and in-person trainings, support topic-specific working groups, and provide help, training, and tutorials for scientists.

## Online trainings

SCINet is working to bring certified courses in statistics, machine learning, and programming through partnerships with online education vendors like Coursera.  Information about those partnerships and information on courses you can start today can be found on [this page](/training/free-online-training).

## Workshops

SCINet sponsors online and in-person workshops on specific topics such as Carpentries courses.  Visit the [upcoming training events](https://scinet.usda.gov/training/training_event) or [training archive](https://scinet.usda.gov/training-archive/) pages for more information. 

## The bioinformatics workbook

SCINet sponsors the development of bioinformatics tutorials for the agency through a partnership with Iowa State. More information on these tutorials can be [found here](/training/bioinformatics-workbook).

## Tutorials

A number of other tutorials on varied topics like machine learning and geospatial analysis can be [found here](/training/tutorials/).

## Data management

Resources on data management can be [found here](/training/useful-links.html)

## Working groups

SCINet provides technical support in the use of our HPCs to approved SCINet and AI COE working groups. Information about these groups can be [found here](https://scinet.usda.gov/working-groups)
