One of SCINet's main objectives is training scientists in computational methods to empower agricultural research. We are doing this in several ways. We offer online and in-person trainings, support topic-specific working groups, and provide help, training, and tutorials for scientists.

## Online trainings

SCINet is working to bring certified courses in Statistics, machine learning, and programming to through partnerships with online education vendors like Coursera
and EdX.  Information about those partnerships and information on courses you can start today can be found on [this page](/training/free-online-training).

## Workshops

SCINet also sponsors online and in-person workshops on specific topics.  Visit the [upcoming](https://scinet.usda.gov/opportunities/events) or [training archive](https://scinet.usda.gov/training-archive/) pages for more information. 

## The bioinformatics workbook

SCINet Sponsors the development of bioinformatics tutorials for the agency through a partnership with Iowa State. More information on these tutorials can be [found here](/training/bioinformatics-workbook).
