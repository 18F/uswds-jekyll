## Use Cases
---
### **Machine Learning**
* Classification
* Clustering: [Python Notebook Example](/assets/img/geospatial/Tutorial1_Example2_Hyperspectral.html)
* Regression

### **Modeling**
* Process Based or Statistical Models

### **Time Series Analysis**
* Estimating Productivity
* Land Use / Land Change

### **Geostatistics**
* Spatial Variance or Autocorrelation
* Kriging / Interpolation

### **Processing Data**
* UAS DN/Radiance to Reflectance

## When to Use SCINet?
---
Setting up analyses to run on SCINet involves a non-trivial amount of overhead. Therefore, you should first evaluate if SCINet is an appropriate avenue for your research. Typically, analyses that are well-suited for SCINet are:
* CPU intensive workloads
* high memory workloads

Additional considerations are:
* Are my analyses already optimized?
* Will I need to parallelize my analyses (typical for CPU intensive workloads)?
* Will I require more than a single node of compute power (ie. distributed computing)?
