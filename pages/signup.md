## ARS Employees

ARS employees can request a SCINet account by filling out a form on the ARS Sharepoint site (eAuthentication required). Anyone with a usda.gov email address working for ARS  should use this link to the ARS Employees form.

<a href="https://e.arsnet.usda.gov/sites/OCIO/scinet/accounts/SitePages/SCINetAccountRequest.aspx" class="usa-button">Request ARS employee account</a>

## Non-ARS Employees

Non-ARS Employees require an ARS employee sponsor to obtain a SCINet account.  Please contact your sponsor and request that they complete a form on your behalf on the ARS Sharepoint site (eAuthentication required). 

Note: if you aren't technically an ARS employee but work for ARS and have a usda.gov email address, do not use the non-ARS Employee link below. Please use the link above for ARS Employees.

###  The ARS sponsor will need your:

1. Full name
2. Email
3. Institution
4. Position
5. Phone number
6. Office address
7. Affiliation(s) with ARS. They will need to enter agreement type(s) (e.g., RSA, NARA), agreement number(s), and agreement title(s) or grant, if applicable.  If other, please indicate any formal relationship between the sponsor and sponsored party e.g. advisory committee.
