### Expanding SCINet for the Future of Science

![SCINet-X visualization](/assets/img/scinet-x-visualization.jpg)

## Overview of the SCINet-X Project

The ARS SCINet Team developed a SCINet network solution that provides two levels of high-bandwidth services to meet the different needs of research locations.  These solutions will accelerate the expansion of high-bandwidth SCINet connectivity to all ARS locations as fast as possible while balancing economic, technological, and local constraints.  The SCINet-X project involves the SCINet Team working with each individual location in ARS to directly connect the location to SCINet.  The following locations that are actively working on establishing high-bandwidth SCINet connectivity. 


| Kimberly, ID | Hilo, HI | Parlier, WA |
| Pendleton, OR | Wenatchee, WA | Burns, OR |
| Manhattan, KS | Lubbock, TX | Bushland, TX |
| Grand Forks, ND | Mandan, ND | Lincoln, NE |
| Peoria, IL | Columbia, MO| Burlington, VT |
| Kearneysville, WV | Orono, ME | Booneville, AR |
| New Orleans, LA | Oxford, MS | Fayetteville, AR |
| Auburn, AL | Griffin, GA | Florence, SC |
| Starkville, MS | Raleigh, NC | Houma, LA |
| Poplarville, AR | Charleston, SC | Dawson, GA |
| Byron, GA | Tifton, GA | Canal Point, FL |
| Mayaguez, PR | Miami, FL | |



We are eager to work with the remaining ARS locations to ensure they are ready when network equipment is available for installation. Please see the steps (milestones) below to be followed in getting a location on our list. The SCINet Team is available to answer questions at any step along the way. 


## Key Milestones for Achieving a high-bandwidth SCINet Connection

1. Location team identifies local network provider, which often involves an agreement with a university or working with a local internet provider
1. Location team completes [online location survey](https://forms.office.com/g/6MKNsiz7DS)
1. Location team works with SCINet team to finalize installation details
1. Location team finalizes network connection and agreement with university or local internet provider
1. Location team initiates network service and SCINet installs network hardware
1. SCINet team establishes location's SCINet-X connection and begins operational support and monitoring
