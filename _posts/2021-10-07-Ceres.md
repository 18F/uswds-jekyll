Ceres maintenance is scheduled for Thursday, November 11, 2021 to upgrade internal cluster network.

Queued jobs will not start if they cannot complete by 6AM November 11. These include jobs submitted to the long partition with the default 3-weeks long time limit. In the output of the squeue command the reason for those jobs will state (ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance). The jobs will start after the scheduled outage completes. 
 
The Atlas cluster will stay up and running during Ceres downtime. All Ceres users can run jobs on Atlas and use /90daydata that has no quotas.
