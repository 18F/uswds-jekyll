This 90-mintue information session is for anyone interested in learning more about USDA’s new state-of-the art supercomputer Atlas. Atlas is a high-performance computer with 101 terabytes of total RAM designed to help power research advances in biocomputing, epidemiology, geospatial technology and more. This introduction will cover a range of topics that include everything from a general overview of high-performance computing and why you might want to take advantage of its capabilities in your research to basic protocols associated with using Atlas (how to gain access to Atlas, how to log-in to your account, how to transfer data, etc.). This introduction session will be led by Dr. Adam Thrash, MSU Research Associate and Computer Specialist with MSU’s Institute of Genomics, Biocomputing, and Biotechnology.
