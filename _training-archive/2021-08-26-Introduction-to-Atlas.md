Dr. Adam Thrash, MSU Research Associate and Computer Specialist with MSU’s Institute of Genomics, Biocomputing, and Biotechnology, held a 90-mintue information session about 
USDA’s supercomputer Atlas. The workshop covered a range of topics that include everything from a general overview of high-performance computing and why one might want to take 
advantage of its capabilities in their research to basic protocols associated with using Atlas (how to gain access to Atlas, how to log-in, how to transfer data, etc.).
