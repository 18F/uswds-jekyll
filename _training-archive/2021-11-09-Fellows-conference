Postdoctoral Research Fellows funded by SCINet or the AI Center of Excellence through the ORISE Program bring a fresh perspective to the ARS scientist community, while allowing these Fellows to learn through hands-on research under our top scientists. Fellows are funded for two-year terms with the goal to support unit and collaborative research using high performance computing and computational science skills.

The SCINet and AI COE Fellows Conference 2021 was held on November 9-10. This conference featured research presentations from the Fellows as well as Fellow-moderated panel conversations on promoting collaboration opportunities.
