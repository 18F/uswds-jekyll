Workshop Goals/Deliverables:
* Build tighter linkages and communication among ARS scientists involved in arthropod genomics research (AGR).
* Forge new collaborations within ARS by explicitly highlighting current and planned AGR within ARS.
* Define critical research gaps or strengths of AGR within ARS.
* Provide a clearer picture of current strengths and weaknesses within ARS relative to cyberinfrastructure, data storage, and analytical resources needed to accomplish ARS-wide goals with respect to AGR.
* Develop a better understanding of available bioinformatics resources (infrastructure and personnel) within ARS.
* Train participating ARS scientists in publicly available analysis tools (iPlant) that will facilitate research on high-throughput genomic data.
* Provide guidance and input for future bioinformatics training of ARS scientists.
* Define role for NAL in AGR in coordinating data standardization and database integration.
* Build roadmap to accomplish ARS-wide goals with respect to AGR.
* Plan movement towards integrative, multidisciplinary, and translational genomics.
